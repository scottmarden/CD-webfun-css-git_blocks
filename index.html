						<h3>What is Git?</h3>
						<p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots(commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapship you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into your app.</p>
						<h3>What is Github?</h3>
						<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version controla and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywehere using those code snapships that you took during development. </p>

							<h4>Git remote add</h4>
							<p><span class="highlight">Git remote</span> add is used to set up an online repository where we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

						<div class="largebox">
							<h4>Git push</h4>
							<p><span class="highlight">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other developers might look at our exisiting projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add</p>
